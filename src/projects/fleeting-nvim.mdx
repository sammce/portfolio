## Why?

<Section id="why?">

Having spent much of my life in front of a text editor, I wanted to quantify the amount of time I had actually spent coding.

After some failed attempts to find an answer to my question, I decided to build my own solution.

</Section>

## How?

<Section id="how?">

The plugin tracks when you enter and leave Neovim, and uses these timestamps to extrapolate how much time you've spent coding.

> Technically speaking, what the plugin tracks is **time spent with neovim open**, which is a good enough heuristic for my use case.
