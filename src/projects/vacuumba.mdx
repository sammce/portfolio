## Overview

<Section id="overview">

This project was a proof of concept for how one could go about building an automated robot vacuum system.

For the hardware, we were required to use [BBC Micro:bits](https://microbit.org/), which are single chip computers, similar in concept to Raspberry PIs.

> There is actually no 'vacuum' functionality, this project instead focused on the self-driving and communication pipelines.

## Components

<Section id="components">

It is comprised of:

- A <TechStackBadge technology="NextJS" inline /> web app for the user to control the vacuum cleaner and view statistics.
- A <TechStackBadge technology="Django" inline /> backend to store data and handle authentication.
- A bespoke <TechStackBadge technology="Python" inline /> serial interface for the backend to communicate with the vacuum controller.
- A wireless communication protocol using radio waves for the controller to communicate with the vacuum.
- Custom self-driving and collision avoidance algorithms for the vacuum.
