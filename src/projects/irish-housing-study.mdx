## Introduction

<Section id="introduction">

The idea behind this project was to forecast Irish housing prices post-covid using trends from a dataset of housing prices released by the Irish government. 

The data included prices from all parts of the country, from 1976 to 2019. It takes into account new builds and second hand purchases.

As this was our first foray into data science & analysis, the project uses a simple linear regression algorithm instead of more advanced machine learning models. If I were to do it again I would certainly do it differently, but it taught me a lot about data cleaning and processing.

## Results

<Section id="results">

As you might expect, we predicted a massive increase in average prices throughout the country. To showcase our results (and some more information about our process), I built a <TechStackBadge technology="React" inline /> web application. 

You can view it at [https://irishhousingstudy.web.app](https://irishhousingstudy.web.app).
