## Rationale

<Section id="rationale">

The Drogheda Grammar School hosts an annual Trade Fair, where students can apply to take part in a day-long Christmas market selling home made goods.

Managing the application process became cumbersome as the number of applications grew. So I was asked by the organiser to develop a solution to streamline it.

</Section>

## Success Criteria

<Section id="success criteria">

The most important problem to solve was to make the application process as simple as possible for students and staff alike.

On top of this, I wanted to take this opportunity to allow students to better advertise their stalls to other students and people in the community.

</Section>

### Features

<Section id="features">

After 6 months of development (while preparing for my Leaving Cert), the initial version was deployed and included:

- Authentication via email & Google OAUTH, scoped to school email addresses.
- Automated email verification and password reset.
- Application submission in accordance with fair guidelines (e.g. stall contract, food safety form)
- Application status tracking.
- A dashboard for the organiser to approve/deny applications, with email notifications.
- A page for each student to advertise their stall & products, with the ability to edit (subject to approval)
- A pre-order system (no payment), including automated QR code generation for each order, allowing for easy pick-up.

</Section>

### Refined

<Section id="refined">

The initial features served their purpose, but there was a lot of room for improvement. Notably, very few students actually used the pre-order system, so the focus shifted to the management of applications and the fair in general.

Throughout the following years, in collaboration with the organiser, the following features were added/changed:

- The pre-order system was removed.
- The ability was added for the organiser to send a message to all stallholders.
- More stall management options were added, including the option to withdraw from the fair.
- A blog was added for the organiser to post updates about the fair.
- As my skills developed, the UI was updated to be more user-friendly.

</Section>

## Impact

<Section id="impact">

The immediate impact of the new application process was evident. Students were able to apply in a matter of minutes, and the organiser had a centralised location for all applications.

The number of applications doubled in that first year (from \~30 to \~60), and the number of applications has continued to grow ever since. This year, there were \~100 applications.

The organiser also reported an exponential decrease in application management effort, allowing them to focus on the fair itself.

</Section>

## Architecture

<Section id="architecture">

![Image of architecture](/projects/trade-fair/architecture-diagram.png)

The application is split into 3 main components:

- <TechStackBadge technology="NextJS" inline /> frontend
- <TechStackBadge technology="Django" inline /> backend, hosted on a <TechStackBadge technology="Linux" inline /> VPS using <TechStackBadge technology="Docker" inline />
- 3rd party services - <TechStackBadge technology="Google OAUTH" inline /> & mail provider

</Section>

### Justification

<Section id="justification">

We knew the expected traffic of the application would be low, being limited to the Drogheda Grammar School community. This, coupled with the requirement of a low-cost solution, led us to choose a simple and low-maintenence architecture.


</Section>

#### NextJS

<Section id="nextjs">

NextJS was the perfect candidate for the frontend, as most of the pages are static and can therefore benefit from Next's Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR). I was also familiar with Next, having previously used it to develop personal projects.

> Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to:
>
> - Update static content without rebuilding the entire site
> - Reduce server load by serving prerendered, static pages for most requests
> - Ensure proper cache-control headers are automatically added to pages
> - Handle large amounts of content pages without long next build times
>
> \- NextJS documentation

The frontend is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), with automated deployment to production and staging environments.

</Section>

#### Django

<Section id="django">

In a similar fashion to NextJS, Django was the perfect candidate for the backend, as it is a mature and well-tested framework with batteries included. I opted to pair it with Django Rest-Framework, which streamlined validation and database querying.

Docker Compose was used to containerise the application and its dependencies, with automated deployment to a VPS on Digital Ocean.

</Section>

#### 3rd Party

<Section id="3rd party">

The authentication process is made much easier by using Google OAUTH, which requires no additional setup on the part of the user. The mail provider is [Zoho](https://zoho.com), which was chosen primarily for its cost effectiveness

</Section>


## Testing Strategy

<Section id="testing strategy">

The application is tested using <TechStackBadge technology="Jest" inline /> for unit/integration tests and <TechStackBadge technology="Cypress" inline /> for e2e tests.

These are integrated into the repository's CI pipeline, aswell as locally using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

On the backend, I used Django's built in testing framework to test the views and serialisers.
