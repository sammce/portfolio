## Justification

<Section id="justification" className="gap-0">

The Drogheda Grammar School hosts an annual Trade Fair, where students can apply to take part in a day-long Christmas market selling home made goods.

This event is loved by students and staff alike, as it gives participants the opportunity to showcase their crafts, and get some valuable business experience while doing so.

### The Problem

<Section id="The problem" className="gap-0">

With the growth in popularity of the fair over the years, administration became a bottleneck, as the event was primarily organised by one member of staff.

With 70+ applications and 40+ stalls, juggling spreadsheets and email lists was a nightmare.

### The Solution

<Section id="The solution" className="gap-0">

The teacher running the Trade Fair realised this, and came to the Computer Science department in search of a solution. As an advocate for Computer Science in the school, I was chosen by the head of the department to take on the challenge.

In collaboration with that teacher, I created the first iteration of the [DGS Trade Fair](https://dgstradefair.ie/) website.
