## Justification

<Section id="justification">

The Drogheda Grammar School hosts an annual Trade Fair, where students can apply to take part in a day-long Christmas market selling home made goods.

Managing the application process became cumbersome as the number of applications grew. So I was asked by the organiser to develop a solution to streamline it.
