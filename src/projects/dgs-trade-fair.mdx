## Rationale

<Section id="rationale">

The Drogheda Grammar School hosts an annual Trade Fair, where students can apply to take part in a day-long Christmas market selling home made goods.

Managing the application process became cumbersome as the number of applications grew. So I was asked by the organiser to develop a solution to streamline it.

</Section>

## Role & Scope

<Section id="role & scope">

Once the fair organiser and I came to a mutual understanding of the necessary features, I took on the role of sole developer.

I was responsible for everything, from design & implementation to testing & deployment.

With this in mind, I was also given the freedon to implement any additional features that I thought might positively impact the user experience.
  
</Section>

## Success Criteria

<Section id="success criteria">

The most important problem to solve was to make the application process as simple as possible for students and staff alike.

On top of this, I wanted to take this opportunity to allow students to better advertise their stalls to other students and people in the community.

</Section>

### Features

<Section id="features">

After 6 months of development (while preparing for my Leaving Cert), the initial version was deployed and included:

- Authentication via email & Google OAUTH, scoped to school email addresses.
- Automated email verification and password reset.
- Application submission in accordance with fair guidelines (e.g. stall contract, food safety form)
- Application status tracking.
- A dashboard for the organiser to approve/deny applications, with email notifications.
- A page for each student to advertise their stall & products, with the ability to edit (subject to approval)
- A pre-order system (no payment), including automated QR code generation for each order, allowing for easy pick-up.

</Section>

### Refined

<Section id="refined">

The initial features served their purpose, but there was a lot of room for improvement. Notably, very few students actually used the pre-order system, so the focus shifted to the management of applications and the fair in general.

Throughout the following years, in collaboration with the organiser, the following features were added/changed:

- The pre-order system was removed.
- The ability was added for the organiser to send a message to all stallholders.
- More stall management options were added, including the option to withdraw from the fair.
- A blog was added for the organiser to post updates about the fair.
- As my skills developed, the UI was updated to be more user-friendly.

</Section>

## Impact

<Section id="impact">

The immediate impact of the new application process was evident. Students were able to apply in a matter of minutes, and the organiser had a centralised location for all applications.

The number of applications doubled in that first year (from \~30 to \~60), and the number of applications has continued to grow ever since. This year, there were \~100 applications.

The organiser also reported an exponential decrease in application management effort, allowing them to focus on the fair itself.

## Architecture
