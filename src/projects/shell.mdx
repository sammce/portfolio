## Introduction

<Section id="introduction">

This project was developed as part of the DCU operating systems module, with the goal of understanding how a shell works at a high level.

The shell supports some basic commands like `cd` and `dir`.

</Section>

## Usage 

<Section id="usage">

- `cd [directory]`: Change the current working directory (CWD) to `directory`. All commands will be executed relative to the CWD.
  If no directory is given, the CWD is printed.
- `clr`: Clear the previously printed content from the screen, showing only the shell prompt.
- `dir [directory]`: List the files/directories in `directory`, or the content of the CWD if no directory is given.
- `environ`: Print the current environment variables, line by line in a NAME=VALUE format.
- `echo [...args]`: Print each of the `args`, separated by a space.
- `help`: Display this message.
- `pause`: Pauses operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.
- `quit`: Quits the shell.

All other commands (aka external commands) will be run as child processes. For example, entering `ls` will
run your system's `ls` command as a child process, and its output will be printed.
