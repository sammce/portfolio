## Context

<Section id="context">

Reasearchers at Stanford created a [dataset](https://ddi-dataset.github.io/) of professionally labeled dermatological images with an even representation of 6 [Fitzpatrick skin phototypes](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/skin-phototype).


As part of their research, Chen et al tested the performance of existing dermatological deep learning models (e.g. DeepDerm and HAM10000), and their performance on non-white skin tones was far worse than on white skin tones.

Our goal was to decrease this gap in accuracy by utilising transfer learning.

## Results

We chose a general purpose CNN model (ResNet152) as our base model, and fine-tuned it with the DDI dataset. After some data augmentation and balancing, we achieved an effective accuracy of 80% on the test set, which we felt was sufficient confirmation that the performance of these lesion classification models could be improved using a similar method.

80% accuracy is nowhere near enough for clinical use, but with further research efforts, the biases built into these models can be mitigated.
